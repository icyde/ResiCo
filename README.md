# ResiCo
Connecting communities together by digitalizing residential notice boards and providing an easier way for residents to talk, ask, and help each other. 
Resico is a Java Android application developed by my team and I for our term 4 module: Infomation Systems & Programming. Frontend and backend was developed using android studio, while we used firebase as the database. Resico is a housing application, with features such as:
1. Community Events sign up
2. Forum for chatting with other residents
3. Announcement page for your residential block
